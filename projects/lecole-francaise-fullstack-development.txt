I created a lead acquisition form using React.js, Docker, and PHP cloud functions, designed to qualify prospects and convert them into clients. My role also involved writing unit and functional tests for React.js, PHP cloud functions. Additionally, I migrated functions and APIs from WordPress to PHP cloud functions and modernized the business application by customizing plugins and themes, including refactoring an outdated WordPress site by developing a new plugin from scratch. I integrated APIs from ActiveCampaign, Zoho, and ChargeBee to enhance the platform's capabilities. This experience required close collaboration with various stakeholders across the company to understand and address their needs effectively.","seoKeywords":["L'École Française","full-stack development","microservices","lead acquisition","Functional Testing","React.js","Symfony","WordPress","PHP","cloud functions","API integration","ActiveCampaign","Zoho","ChargeBee"],"skills":["React.js","Symfony","WordPress","PHP","Docker","Unit Testing","API","ActiveCampaign","Zoho","ChargeBee"],"mainImage":{"url":"/projects/ecole-francaise/main.jpg","alt":"L'École Française Logo","caption":"L'École Française - Online Certified Training"},"images":[{"url":"/projects/ecole-francaise/screen1.png","alt":"L'École Française Platform Interface","caption":"L'École Française Platform Interface"}],"links":[{"url":"https://lecolefrancaise.fr/","type":"website","label":"L'École Française Official Website"}],"features":[{"title":"Microservices Architecture","description":"Developed and migrated multiple PHP cloud functions to enhance system modularity and scalability."},{"title":"Lead Acquisition Form","description":"Created a React.js-based form to qualify prospects and facilitate their conversion into clients."},{"title":"System Modernization","description":"Refactored and modernized the business application by customizing WordPress plugins and themes, including developing a new plugin from scratch."},{"title":"API Integrations","description":"Integrated APIs from ActiveCampaign, Zoho, and ChargeBee to enhance platform capabilities."}],"challenges":["Transitioning from a monolithic to a microservices architecture.","Ensuring seamless integration of various third-party services.","Collaborating with diverse stakeholders to understand and address their specific needs."],"solutions":["Implemented PHP cloud functions to facilitate the migration to a microservices architecture.","Developed robust integration strategies for ActiveCampaign, Zoho, and ChargeBee APIs.","Maintained open communication channels with stakeholders to gather requirements and provide effective solutions."],"techStack":{"frontend":["React.js"],"backend":["Symfony","PHP","WordPress","PHP Cloud Functions","Google Cloud Functions"],"devops":["Docker"],"other":["ActiveCampaign API","Zoho API","ChargeBee API"]},"timeline":{"started":"2023-10","completed":"2024-11","status":"completed"},"team":{"size":10,"roles":["Senior Full-Stack Developer","CTO","Project Manager","Backend Developer","UI/UX Designer","Product Owner"]},"metrics":{"custom":[{"label":"Daily traffic","value":"10000"}]}}}]]}]
