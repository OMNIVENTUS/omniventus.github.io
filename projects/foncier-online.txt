13:T520,FoncierOnline is a robust and fully-featured real estate valuation platform that optimizes the entire property estimation process. The application enables property owners to submit detailed valuation requests via an intuitive multi-step form, upload relevant documents, and receive tailored assessments from experts. It features dedicated dashboards for both clients and administrators, with secure real-time communication and private consultation workflows. 

The project was developed under the technical leadership of a senior fullstack developer from LAZONE â€” a company specializing in sourcing reliable French-speaking tech talents. As Lead Developer, I was responsible for structuring the technical roadmap, defining the architecture and tech stack with the development team, managing the planning and feature scope with the client, and ensuring timely delivery. I led a multidisciplinary remote team composed of frontend, backend, DevOps, and UI/UX contributors, handling code reviews, architecture decisions, and overall project coordination from inception to production.

Built using a modern monorepo architecture powered by Turborepo, the platform integrates a performant stack including Next.js, Chakra UI, TypeScript, GraphQL, and Strapi CMS, ensuring scalability, modularity, and maintainability.8:["$","$10",null,{"fallback":["$","p",null,{"children":"Loading project..."}],"children":[["$","$L11",null,{"moduleIds":["app/projects/[id]/page.tsx ->
